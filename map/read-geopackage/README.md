# Read a GeoPackage

Add rasters and feature tables from a GeoPackage to a map.

## Use case

The OGC GeoPackage specification defines an open standard for sharing raster and vector data. You may want to use GeoPackage files to support file-based sharing of geographic data.

## How to use the sample

When the sample loads, the feature layers and rasters from the GeoPackage will be shown on the map.

## How it works

1. Get the GeoPackage and load it using `geoPackage.loadAsync()`.
2. Iterate through available rasters, exposed by `geopackage.getGeoPackageRasters()`. For each raster, create a raster layer using `new RasterLayer(geopackageRaster)`, then add it to the map.
3. Iterate through available feature tables, exposed by `geopackage.getGeoPackageFeatureTables()`. For each feature table, create a feature layer using `new FeatureLayer(geopackageFeatureTable)`, then add it to the map.

## About the data

This sample features a GeoPackage with datasets that cover Aurora, Colorado: Public art (points), Bike trails (lines), Subdivisions (polygons), Airport noise (raster), and liquour license density (raster).

## Additional information

GeoPackage uses a single SQLite file (.gpkg) that conforms to the OGC GeoPackage Standard. You can create a GeoPackage file (.gpkg) from your own data using the create a SQLite Database tool in ArcGIS Pro.
