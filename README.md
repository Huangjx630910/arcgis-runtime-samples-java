# ArcGIS Runtime Java SDK Samples

 [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/esri/arcgis/arcgis-java/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/esri/arcgis/arcgis-java/_latestVersion)

This repo contains a set of sample projects demonstrating how to accomplish various mapping and GIS tasks with the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Java.

Browse the category directories to explore the samples. Each sample is an individual [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html) project that can be run standalone. The Gradle buildscripts have tasks for running the application, building a jar, and distributing the app as a zip.

Installing Gradle is not necessary since each sample includes the Gradle wrapper.

## Instructions

### IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and select _File > Open..._.
2. Choose one of the sample project directories (not the category folder) and click _OK_.
3. Select _File > Project Structure..._ and ensure that the Project SDK and language level are set to use Java 11.
4. Open the Gradle view with _View > Tool Windows > Gradle_.
5. In the Gradle view, double-click the `run` task under _Tasks > application_ to run the app.

### Eclipse

1. Open Eclipse and select _File > Import_.
2. In the import wizard, choose _Gradle > Existing Gradle Project_, then click _Next_.
3. Choose one of the sample project directories (not the category folder) as the project root directory.
4. Click _Finish_ to complete the import.
5. Open the Gradle Tasks view with _Window > Show View > Other... > Gradle > Gradle Tasks_.
6. In the Gradle Tasks view, double-click the `run` task under _{project_name} > application_ to run the app.

### Terminal

1. `cd` into one of the sample project directories (not the category folder).
2. Run `./gradlew run` on Linux/Mac or `gradlew.bat run` on Windows to run the app.

### Java 11
Java 11 users may find exceptions when running the project if their library path is still set for Oracle JDK 1.8 (see the [OpenJavaFX docs](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/) for more information). A workaround for this is to add the following argument in the `run` task of the Gradle buildscript:
```
systemProperty "java.library.path", "C:\tmp"
```

### Offline sample data
Some samples require offline data. A `samples-data` directory will automatically download to the project root when the Gradle project is configured/imported.

## Requirements
